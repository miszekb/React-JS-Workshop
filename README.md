# React-JS-Workshop
Container for tiny ReactJS projects, created during my learning process

# #1 Micro blog app
App which allows us to create account, log in and add o remove posts. It was created to get to know with React project structure and component architecture. I also made use of Firebase database to store all the posts and users.

# #3 React Native Blog app
It shares the same features like previous project, but with extra ones:
- Local Weather (current IP is sent to proper weather API)
- Posts contain flags of countries of origin (also based on current IP - tested with VPN, works well :) )

# #3 Hello World App
Nothing special :/

# #4 Burger Builder App
This aplication is based on one of Udemy tutorials. It allows user to build his own burger from components (like beef patty, cheese etc.) and get final cost.
